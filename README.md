### Guten Tag ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

I thought "Hey! Other people have GitHub profile README files, so why don't I?

I currently lead development on:
- [Stencil](https://getstencil.com/?gh)
- [Zenlogin](https://zenlogin.co/?gh)

And [Iconduck](https://iconduck.com/?gh) is a side project I run, which aggregates open source icons, illustrations, emojis and graphics into one place.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:onassar@gmail.com) if you wanna chat, contribute, or want to buy me an HBO Go subscription.
